## Project Purpose
The Makka Live Bot provides a secure, remote-controlled way to stream high-quality audio from YouTube to Discord. By separating the bot engine (backend) from the control interface (frontend dashboard), users can host the bot on their local machines without exposing sensitive credentials or complex source code.
